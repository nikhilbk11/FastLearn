                        <p>It's sometimes said, even by those who promote eLearning,   that some subjects are easier to learn online than others. Usually this   is because some complex subjects require a lot of back-and-forth   questioning to achieve understanding. When you have to ask three or four   questions in a row to zero in on understanding, that's something that   takes a minute or two in the classroom, but could take several days on a   threaded discussion board. Now, online courses that make use of live   chat sessions or teleconferencing can eliminate that difficulty, but   such technologies are far from universal in online education, at least   so far.</p>
                        <p>Because of this, one of the subjects that has been considered   a poor choice for online study is that of foreign languages. Most   schools that specialize in online learning don't even offer courses in   foreign languages, even as electives. And that's a shame. Particularly   in a world where globalization is advancing, and more and more   opportunity is found abroad, the ability to learn a foreign language or   two can go a long way toward propelling one's career forward. Even those   who are interested only in opportunities in the U.S. would find it   useful at least to learn Spanish, which has essentially become the   second language of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Now, however, the Chronicle of Higher Education is reporting   that things may be picking up for learning languages through eLearning.   The article lists all sorts of different technologies that help people   learn another language, making it seem more surprising than anything   else that there's so little emphasis on doing so for credit. And it says   that in some cases, students are learning languages online not from a   preference, but simply because it's that way or no way. Two cases that   highlight this seem like opposites, but have the same effect — when it's   difficult to find enough instructors to cover a popular language, it   may be easier to find additional instructors to teach online, and when   there are only a few students interested in learning a particular   language, it may make sense to work with other institutions with the   same issue to offer an online course in that language jointly.</p>
                        <p>eLearners often note that it takes more discipline to thrive   in our environment than it does on campus because there's no one there   reminding a student at home or work about all the things that are   necessary to do. There's only the student remembering to do everything   required, and making the time to do all of those things as each week   progresses. With foreign language study, this is even more the case. In   courses that are based on opinion or interpretation, an intelligent   student may sometimes be able to get with putting things together at the   last minute. But when it comes to learning a language, nothing will do   but practice, practice, practice. Good luck faking that!</p>
                        <p>So would you consider using eLearning to pick up another   language? It might not be the easiest undertaking, whether online or on   campus, but the potential rewards are there. Perhaps we indeed will see a   noticeable increase in the number of students taking advantage of this   opportunity!</p>
