                      <p>Welcome to The eLearning Guild membership service (hereafter the   &quot;Service&quot;). Please read this Privacy, Membership and Terms of Use   Agreement (hereafter Agreement) carefully before using this service. By   using the Service, you accept and agree to the terms contained hereunder   and the terms of this Privacy, Membership and Terms of Use Agreement.   If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the service. We   may change the terms from time to time, and it is your responsibility to   review them periodically to make sure that you are current on the   guidelines. </p>
                      <h3>General</h3>
                      <p>This Service is owned and operated by Focuszone Media, Inc., 120   Stony Point Rd., Suite 125, Santa Rosa, CA 95401. The Service offers   Users (as defined below) access to information, resources and   interpersonal networking services and other content assets owned or   licensed by The eLearning Guild. </p>
                      <p>Please note that all visitors and members in any category will be   referred to hereafter as &quot;User&quot; in this Agreement. Each User must be 18   years or older to establish a Member Profile. &quot;Member Profile&quot; means   the account registered to any User pursuant to the registration   procedures for the Service. The terms of this Agreement apply to all   Users. The User for any Member Profile Account is entirely liable for   all activities conducted through that Account. </p>
                      <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                      <p>When you register to be a User of The eLearning Guild you must   provide the required contact information and general information about   you and your organization. We will also ask you to create a Username and   Password and to provide other optional information. We maintain this   information in a Member Profile which you control. Information collected   in member profiles is used to better understand Users' use of the   Service and to support related transactions made on the site. As a   registered Guild User you will be automatically placed on a list to   receive the eLearning Insider e-mail newsletter that is sent each week   to all Users. If you wish to stop receiving eLearning Insider, you may   opt-out at any time by following instructions on the bottom of each   eLearning Insider email. We may also use Member Profile information to   occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web   site, offerings and services from The eLearning Guild, and special   offers from sponsors. If you wish to stop receiving these   communications, you may opt-out at any time by following instructions on   the bottom of each email. </p>
                      <p>At the end of your first year as a registered User, you will be   notified that it is time to either (i) renew your membership or (ii)   upgrade from one membership category to another, or (iii) to opt-out of   your membership entirely. </p>
                      <h3>Personal Information to Other Parties</h3>
                      <p>The eLearning Guild does sell e-mail addresses or other general   information that Users voluntarily provide in any registration process   to other parties. The eLearning Guild, however, may facilitate the   distribution of 3rd party offers to your postal address and/or email   address until you specifically opt-out of those 3rd party   communications. To facilitate these 3rd party distributions, The   eLearning Guild may authorize a secure and bonded service bureau to   process data to support any such 3rd party communication on our behalf.   If you wish to stop receiving 3rd party communications, you may opt-out   at any time by following instructions on the bottom of each email. The   eLearning Guild and Focuszone Media, Inc. may also use e-mail addresses   and other personally identifiable information to communicate with Users   who initiate communications with us. </p>
                      <p>The eLearning Guild may disclose your personally identifiable   information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in   order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena or other legal process.   We may also disclose this information if we have reason to believe that   disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring   legal action against someone who may be violating our terms of service   or to protect the safety of our Users and the public. </p>
                      <h3>Non-transferability of Membership</h3>
                      <p>As a registered User of this Service, The eLearning Guild grants   to you a personal, nonexclusive, non-assignable, and nontransferable   license to use and display the information offered by the Service on any   machine(s) of which you are the primary user. You acknowledge that you   may not sub-license, transfer, sell, or assign this license or the   Service without written authorization from The eLearning Guild. Any   attempt to sub-license, transfer, sell, loan, or assign the license may   result in its immediate termination.</p>
                      <h3>Intellectual Property Rights - No Duplication or </h3>
                      <p>The Service provides certain services and benefits for registered   Users and derives its revenue from the production and distribution of   those services and benefits for the exclusive use of registered Users.   Users of the service acknowledge that the duplication and/or   redistribution of content, information, data, or other intellectual   property gained through exclusive access to the Service to any other   party would be a violation of applicable copyright laws and therefore   would cause harm to the Service. User's hereby agree that duplication   and/or redistribution of any materials to any non-member shall require   prior written authorization from an authorized agent of the Service. It   is further agreed, that any specific instance in which written   authorization is granted by the Service, does not authorize the User to   duplicate and/or redistribute any other material than that for which   written authorization was granted.</p>
                      <h3>Security</h3>
                      <p>As part of the registration process each User will select a   Username and Password. You shall provide The eLearning Guild with   accurate, complete, and regularly updated Member Profile information.   You agree to notify The eLearning Guild by email at   service@elearningguild.com of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s)   of your User Account, or any known or suspected breach of security,   including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your Username   and/or Password. You shall be responsible for maintaining the   confidentiality of your Password. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise   illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your User Account, at   The eLearning Guild's sole discretion, and you may be reported to   appropriate law-enforcement agencies. </p>
                      <h3>Personal Information Security</h3>
                      <p>The eLearning Guild implements a variety of standard web security   measures to maintain the safety and security of your personal   information. Of course you may use the site anonymously as a visitor,   but any personal information you provide to become a Registered User   will be protected by secured networks and is only accessible by a   limited number of employees who have special access rights to such   systems. We recommend that, if you share your computer or use a computer   that is accessed by the general public (i.e., a University or library,   etc.), you remember to close your browser window when you have finished   your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your   personal information.</p>
                      <h3>Cookies</h3>
                      <p>Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can   transfer to a User's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his   or her visit to the site. Cookies allow web site operators to better   customize site visits to the visitor's individual preferences. The use   of cookies is standard on the Internet and most major web sites use   them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can   usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are   sent a cookie. This gives you the opportunity to decide whether or not   to accept it. The Service will attempt to install a cookie to your   browser that will enable it to recognize you whenever you return to the   site. This action will expedite your access of various members benefits   and materials. If you choose not to allow the Services cookie to be   installed to your browser, please be aware that you may have difficulty   accessing some content assets.</p>
                      <h3>Termination of Membership</h3>
                      <p>Associate memberships are effective until terminated by either   party. Paid memberships are effective until they expire, at which time   they are downgraded to Associate level, or are terminated by either   party. Although it is assumed that all memberships will remain active   for one year, you may terminate your membership and your right to use   the Service at any time by sending a letter on your company letterhead,   stating your reasons for terminating, to The eLearning Guild. The   eLearning Guild may terminate your account or access rights to this   Service immediately without notice, if in The eLearning Guild's sole   discretion, you fail to comply with any term or provision of this   Agreement. Upon termination, you must destroy all materials obtained   from this Service and all copies thereof. The eLearning Guild may   terminate the Service, or any element of the Service, at any time   without notice. Refunds will not be issued for canceled memberships.</p>

                      <p>The Discussion Board, Job Board, and Resource Directory shall be   used for lawful purposes only.

No conduct shall be undertaken that, in our judgment, restricts or   inhibits any other User from using or enjoying the Service. Advertising   or explicit commercial solicitations may NOT posted on or transmitted   through the Service without our express prior written approval. </p>
